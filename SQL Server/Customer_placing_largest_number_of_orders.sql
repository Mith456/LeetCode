Query the customer_number from the orders table for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.
It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The orders table is defined as follows:

| Column            | Type      |
|-------------------|-----------|
| order_number (PK) | int       |
| customer_number   | int       |
| order_date        | date      |
| required_date     | date      |
| shipped_date      | date      |
| status            | char(15)  |
| comment           | char(200) |
